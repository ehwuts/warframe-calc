# WeaponCalc

## Calculations

-   [ ] beam weapons have unique scaling from status chance?
-   [ ] beam weapons have inconsistent benefits from multishot upon damage
-   [ ] beam weapons have inconsistent benefits from multishot upon status chance
-   [ ] charge trigger uses charge rate, which has minor scaling differences beyond being an inverse of fire rate
-   [ ] charge trigger weapons usually have the ability to fire partially charged, for scaling base damage
-   [ ] charge trigger weapons would be useful to display modded charge rate in addition to effective fire rate
-   [ ] burst trigger has a more complicated effective fire rate than burst count * rate
-   [ ] pellet calculations need verification for inherent multishot weapons because they're not always consistent
-   [ ] ammo consumption isn't always 1 per shot
-   [ ] support multiple Attacks defined in one weapon
-   [ ] magazineless weapons, eg bows
-   [ ] sniper combo
-   [x] sniper zoom effects
