Local App Usage: When using a local deployment, certain 
browsers block AJAX from requesting files no the local machine. 
This can be worked around by using a lightweight webserver such 
as python's SimpleHTTPServer or with browser-specific options 
such as Chrome's --allow-file-access-from-files.

GOALS
The goal of this project is to produce a fully featured weapon 
calculator for Warframe.

Goal Features:
    1 Fully clientside logic with static data modules. 
        * Leaning async json to load weapon/enemy 
          stats, trading increased file requests 
          for reduced standing memory?
    2 ?Display as per ingame.
    3 Display actual, with "Effective" unmerged.
    4 Display Single shot/Burst/Sustained DPS
        * merged and per-type
    5 Built in support for drop-in localization. 
        One of:
        * pregen endpoints from template
        * dynamically fill after page load
Secondary Features:
    1 Enemy Scaling Calculator
    2 Per-mod value calcs
    3 Condition damage calcs sufficiently accurate
      as to be meaningful.
    4 Damage effectiveness for enemy resource combinations
    5 Tileset-based enemy spreads for #4
